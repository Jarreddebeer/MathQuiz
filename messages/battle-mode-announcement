Hey MathChallengers,

We have exciting things coming up this week. Hope you've been practising because
we have a whole new *Battle Mode* being released soon! Soon you will be able
to play head to head against your friends and enemies. It is time to show them who is best!

You better get practising. If you love, hate or really enjoy /The MathChallenge/
don't forget to send us some $Feedback$.

Good Luck,
Yaseen
